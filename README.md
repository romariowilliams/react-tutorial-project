This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Requirements

### `Install nodejs and npm`
This can be downloaded here: https://nodejs.org/en/

### `Install gulp`
Ensure that you have installed npm.  
You can verify this by using the command:
```shell
npm -v
```

In the command terminal, navigate to your project folder, then use the following commands: 
```shell
npm install -g gulp@3.9.1
npm install --save-dev gulp@3.9.1
```

## Gulp commands:
### `gulp`
Runs the commands in the gulpfile. The gulpfile has been made in a way to grab all the SASS files and convert each to a minified CSS file. 

## NPM Commands:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
